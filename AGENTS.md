# AGENTS.md

## Scope
Authoritative reference for repository architecture and agent workflows. Codebase contradictions to this document must be resolved in favor of this document.

## Project Vision

Abyss Engine is a **beautiful, immersive spaced-repetition learning platform** built as a 3D crystal garden.
Core fantasy: *Your knowledge literally grows as glowing crystals in a mystical abyss.*

Core stack: @react-three/fiber@10.0.0-alpha.x, @react-three/drei@11.0.0-alpha.x, WebGPU (Three.js Shading Language), TanStack Query, Zustand, Tailwind, motion.
Core systems: SM-2 progression, ritual-based attunement, buff engine, procedural node-based graphics.

## Architectural Patterns

### 1. Feature-Sliced Modules
- **Rule**: Domain/application modules that encode game-learning behavior must reside exclusively in `src/features/<feature>/`.
- **Boundary Enforcement**: Modules communicate strictly through public APIs defined in `index.ts`. Cross-feature deep imports are prohibited.
- **Dependency Flow**: Features may depend on `infrastructure` and `types`. Unidirectional coupling (feature -> infrastructure/types) is mandatory. Cross-feature coupling must be documented.

### 2. Strict Layered Architecture
- **Types (`src/types`)**: Data contracts and interface shapes. Zero framework or runtime logic.
- **Presentation (`src/components`)**: Rendering and UI event orchestration. Prohibited from owning primary business rules.
- **Features (`src/features`)**: Domain/application modules. This includes **procedural generation models** (mathematical algorithms mapping SM-2 progression to physical growth parameters).
- **Graphics & Rendering (`src/graphics`)**: WebGPU pipelines, TSL node materials, compute shaders, and post-processing effect chains. This layer translates data-driven growth parameters into visual outputs.
- **Composition (`src/hooks`)**: State and query wiring. Prohibited from containing rule-bearing business logic.
- **Infrastructure (`src/infrastructure`)**: External boundaries (I/O, storage, network adapters, realtime wiring).

### 3. Repository Pattern & Data Access
- **Rule**: Direct remote I/O (e.g., `fetch`) is strictly prohibited in domain and component files.
- **Implementation**: Contracts must be defined in `src/types/repository.ts`. Concrete implementations must remain isolated in `src/infrastructure/repositories/*`.
- **Query Orchestration**: Content reads must execute through repository-backed query helpers. Runtime environment decisions (URLs, stale policies, retry behavior) are managed via infrastructure hooks, not domain modules.

### 4. Data-Driven Engine Pattern (Buff System)
- **Separation of Concerns**:
  - `buffDefinitions.ts`: Static configuration and entity definition (what exists).
  - `buffEngine.ts`: Core runtime rules and logic (how it behaves).
  - `buffDisplay.ts`: Presentation mapping (how it looks).
  - `progressionStore.ts`: Lifecycle and state management (when it triggers).

### 5. WebGPU & Mobile-First Graphics Engine
- **Renderer Initialization**: The standard `<Canvas>` import from `@react-three/fiber` is strictly prohibited. You must import `<Canvas>` exclusively from `@react-three/fiber/webgpu` to natively initialize the asynchronous `WebGPURenderer`. Manual `gl` prop instantiation of the WebGPU renderer is deprecated.
- **State API Refactoring**: The `state.gl` property is deprecated in R3F v10. Access the renderer exclusively via `state.renderer` across all components and `useFrame` hooks.
- **Drei Component Import Paths**: The root `@react-three/drei` entry point is forbidden, as it defaults to legacy WebGL implementations. All Drei components must be imported via their dedicated WebGPU entry points (e.g., `@react-three/drei/webgpu`).
- **Drei Component Fallbacks**: If a specific Drei utility lacks a WebGPU entry point in v11, its usage is prohibited. You must reconstruct the required functionality from scratch using Three.js Shading Language (TSL) and Node Materials.
- **Materials & TSL**: Legacy materials (`MeshStandardMaterial`, `ShaderMaterial`, etc.) and raw GLSL strings are strictly prohibited. Use Node Materials (`MeshStandardNodeMaterial`) and Three.js Shading Language (TSL) exclusively. Bind uniforms and manage state-driven material updates using R3F v10's native WebGPU hooks: `useNodes`, `useLocalNodes`, and `useUniforms`.
- **Post-Processing & Pipelines**: The `@react-three/postprocessing` library and `EffectComposer` are forbidden. Implement post-processing using native WebGPU nodes and the R3F v10 `usePostProcessing` hook. Use the `RenderPipeline` API (Three r182+) instead of the deprecated `PostProcessing` API. Replace `WebGLCubeRenderTarget` with `CubeRenderTarget`. Apply additive blending for Screen Space Reflections (SSR) instead of `blendColor()`.
- **Lifecycle & Timers**: `THREE.Clock` is deprecated. Implement all timing logic using `THREE.Timer`. Leverage the R3F v10 standalone scheduler to decouple frame loops and execute them outside the `<Canvas>` tree for UI synchronization when necessary.
- **Lighting & Scene Graph**: Cameras are automatically attached to the scene graph; do not manually attach objects to cameras. WebGPU shadow precision requires decreasing or removing legacy WebGL shadow biases. Recalibrate exposures if using `RoomEnvironment` (PMREM positioning changed) or `Sky`/`SkyMesh` (legacy gamma removed).

## Mandatory Project Rules
- **Data-Driven Execution**: No magic strings. No manual state mapping.
- **No Legacy Burden**: Deprecated behavior must be refactored or removed. Do not preserve dead code.
- **WebGPU Strictness**: Any pull request or code generation that introduces a legacy WebGL material, `WebGLRenderer`, `state.gl`, `THREE.Clock`, or non-TSL shader string into the codebase will be rejected.
- **Mobile-First**: All UI must be adapted to mobile devices.
- **UI Composition**: Build 2D UI only from existing `src/components/ui/*` primitives. Do not add or modify files in this directory unless explicitly instructed to do so with mention of the filename in request.

## Agent Workflow & Decision Framework
Agents must execute the following structured decision process before outputting code modifications to force planned, architectural alignment.

### I. Architectural Alignment Assessment
Before generating code, the agent must evaluate the request against the architecture:
1. **Target Pattern Identification**: Define which architectural pattern governs the proposed change.
2. **Boundary Verification**: Confirm the proposed change maintains Feature-Sliced Modules and Layered Architecture boundaries.
3. **State Strategy**: Validate state modifications. Prefer existing Zustand actions. Introduce new global state patterns only with explicit architectural justification.

### II. Implementation & Testing Execution
1. Identify affected execution paths.
2. Locate and update existing related tests (`src/**/*.test.ts` for unit, `tests/` for e2e) before writing implementation code.
3. Provide necessary unit or e2e tests for new feature paths.
4. Run `npm run build` to ensure the codebase compiles.

### III. Mandatory Collaboration Output
Every agent response proposing code changes must begin with an **Architecture Alignment Plan** containing:
1. **Misalignment Risk**: A concise list of potential high-risk conflicts between the requested change and current architecture.
2. **Implementation Strategy**: The selected architectural pattern and boundary defense strategy.

Welcome, agent.
Let’s build the most beautiful learning garden in existence. 🌌
