# CLAUDE.md

## Scope
Authoritative reference for repository architecture and agent workflows. Codebase contradictions to this document must be resolved in favor of this document.

## Project Vision

Abyss Engine is a **beautiful, immersive spaced-repetition learning platform** built as a 3D crystal garden.
Core fantasy: *Your knowledge literally grows as glowing crystals in a mystical abyss.*

Core stack: @react-three/fiber@10.0.0-alpha.x, @react-three/drei@11.0.0-alpha.x, three@0.183.x, WebGPU (Three.js Shading Language), TanStack Query, Zustand, Tailwind, motion.
Core systems: SM-2 progression, ritual-based attunement, buff engine, procedural node-based graphics.

## Architectural Patterns

### 1. Feature-Sliced Modules
- **Rule**: Domain/application modules that encode game-learning behavior must reside exclusively in `src/features/<feature>/`.
- **Boundary Enforcement**: Modules communicate strictly through public APIs defined in `index.ts`. Cross-feature deep imports are prohibited.
- **Dependency Flow**: Features may depend on `infrastructure` and `types`. Unidirectional coupling (feature → infrastructure/types) is mandatory. Cross-feature coupling must be documented.
- **Authorized exception — `eventBusHandlers`**: `src/infrastructure/eventBusHandlers.ts` may import from `src/features/*` to register side-effect handlers (telemetry sinks, content-generation jobs, `crystalCeremonyStore` triggers, and similar) on the typed `AppEventBus`. This file is the **single sanctioned composition root** where infrastructure wires application-level reactions to domain events. Do not add new "infrastructure calls features" modules without updating this document.

### 2. Strict Layered Architecture
- **Types (`src/types`)**: Data contracts and interface shapes. Zero framework or runtime logic.
- **Presentation (`src/components`)**: Rendering and UI event orchestration. Prohibited from owning primary business rules.
- **Features (`src/features`)**: Domain/application modules. This includes **procedural generation models** (mathematical algorithms mapping SM-2 progression to physical growth parameters).
- **Graphics & Rendering (`src/graphics`)**: WebGPU pipelines, TSL node materials, compute shaders, and post-processing effect chains. This layer translates data-driven growth parameters into visual outputs.
- **Composition (`src/hooks`)**: State and query wiring. Prohibited from containing rule-bearing business logic.
- **Infrastructure (`src/infrastructure`)**: External boundaries (I/O, storage, network adapters, realtime wiring). The typed app event bus (`eventBus.ts`) lives here; handler wiring (`eventBusHandlers.ts`) uses the feature-import exception documented under Feature-Sliced Modules.

### 3. Repository Pattern & Data Access
- **Rule**: Direct remote I/O (e.g., `fetch`) is strictly prohibited in domain and component files.
- **Implementation**: Contracts must be defined in `src/types/repository.ts`. Concrete implementations must remain isolated in `src/infrastructure/repositories/*`.
- **Query Orchestration**: Content reads must execute through repository-backed query helpers. Runtime environment decisions (URLs, stale policies, retry behavior) are managed via infrastructure hooks, not domain modules.

### 4. Data-Driven Engine Pattern (Buff System)
- **Separation of Concerns**:
  - `buffDefinitions.ts`: Static configuration and entity definition (what exists).
  - `buffEngine.ts`: Core runtime rules and logic (how it behaves).
  - `buffDisplay.ts`: Presentation mapping (how it looks).
  - `progressionStore.ts`: Lifecycle and state management (when it triggers).

### 5. WebGPU & Mobile-First Graphics Engine
- **Renderer Initialization**: The standard `<Canvas>` import from `@react-three/fiber` is strictly prohibited. You must import `<Canvas>` exclusively from `@react-three/fiber/webgpu` to natively initialize the asynchronous `WebGPURenderer`. Manual `gl` prop instantiation of the WebGPU renderer is deprecated.
- **State API Refactoring**: The `state.gl` property is deprecated in R3F v10. Access the renderer exclusively via `state.renderer` across all components and `useFrame` hooks.
- **Drei Component Import Paths**: The root `@react-three/drei` entry point is forbidden, as it defaults to legacy WebGL implementations. All Drei components must be imported via their dedicated WebGPU entry points (e.g., `@react-three/drei/webgpu`).
- **Drei Component Fallbacks**: If a specific Drei utility lacks a WebGPU entry point in v11, its usage is prohibited. You must reconstruct the required functionality from scratch using Three.js Shading Language (TSL) and Node Materials.
- **Materials & TSL**: Legacy materials (`MeshStandardMaterial`, `ShaderMaterial`, etc.) and raw GLSL strings are strictly prohibited. Use Node Materials (`MeshStandardNodeMaterial`) and Three.js Shading Language (TSL) exclusively. Bind uniforms and manage state-driven material updates using R3F v10's native WebGPU hooks: `useNodes`, `useLocalNodes`, and `useUniforms`.
- **Post-Processing & Pipelines**: The `@react-three/postprocessing` library and `EffectComposer` are forbidden. Implement post-processing using native WebGPU nodes and the R3F v10 `usePostProcessing` hook. Use the `RenderPipeline` API (Three r183+) instead of the deprecated `PostProcessing` API. Replace `WebGLCubeRenderTarget` with `CubeRenderTarget`. Apply additive blending for Screen Space Reflections (SSR) instead of `blendColor()`.
- **Lifecycle & Timers**: `THREE.Clock` is deprecated. Implement all timing logic using `THREE.Timer`. Leverage the R3F v10 standalone scheduler to decouple frame loops and execute them outside the `<Canvas>` tree for UI synchronization when necessary.
- **Lighting & Scene Graph**: Cameras are automatically attached to the scene graph; do not manually attach objects to cameras. WebGPU shadow precision requires decreasing or removing legacy WebGL shadow biases. Recalibrate exposures if using `RoomEnvironment` (PMREM positioning changed) or `Sky`/`SkyMesh` (legacy gamma removed).

## Mandatory Project Rules
- **Prioritize Strategic Programming over Tactical fixes.** You are strictly forbidden from implementing 'Workarounds,' 'Kludges,' 'Band-aids,' or 'Stopgaps' that introduce Architectural Erosion (e.g., leaking abstractions, breaking encapsulation, or creating brittle error handling) without my explicit consent.
  - **Standard Operating Procedure:**
    - Root Cause over Symptom: If a component (e.g., an external API, a module, or a model) produces invalid or unexpected output, do not write 'defensive' fallback logic or multiple parsers to 'clean' the data.
    - Explicit Failure: Instead of masking errors with soft-handling, write code that throws a hard, descriptive error at the boundary.
    - Upstream Mitigation: Your primary solution must address the source of the failure (e.g., fixing configuration, adjusting parameters, or correcting the upstream logic) rather than accommodating the failure downstream.
  - **Prefer deterministic execution over probabilistic "recovery."** Treat ambiguity, flakiness, and non-reproducibility as defects to eliminate at the source—not as signals to add more branches, retries, or heuristics.

- **Curriculum prerequisite edges (narrow exception):** For subject-graph Stage B (`subject-graph-edges`), invalid prerequisite entries from the model may be **removed** and missing tier requirements **filled deterministically** (lattice topic order: first tier-1 / first tier-2 as needed) before Zod validation. This is **not** a second parser or probabilistic recovery: a single documented repair pass (`correctPrereqEdges`), logged to console, job `metadata.prereqEdgesCorrection`, and telemetry when applied. Upstream mitigation remains choosing a capable **subjectGenerationEdges** model; repair only prevents hard-fail on fixable structural mistakes (for example same-tier prerequisite edges).

- **Data-Driven Execution**: No magic strings. No manual state mapping.
- **No Legacy Burden**: Deprecated behavior must be refactored or removed. Do not preserve dead code.
- **WebGPU Strictness**: Any pull request or code generation that introduces a legacy WebGL material, `WebGLRenderer`, `state.gl`, `THREE.Clock`, or non-TSL shader string into the codebase will be rejected.
- **Mobile-first UI**: Design for small screens and touch as the baseline. Tappable targets must meet comfortable touch sizing and spacing. Do not rely on hover, :hover-only styling, or cursor affordances (cursor-pointer, group-hover:*, tooltips that only appear on hover) to communicate interactivity; use always-visible labels, icons, borders, or other persistent cues. Pointer hover may refine appearance only if the default (non-hover) state is already clearly interactive.
- **UI Composition**: Build 2D UI only from existing `src/components/ui/*` primitives. Do not add or modify files in this directory unless explicitly instructed to do so with mention of the filename in request.
- **Analytics SDK isolation**: The `posthog-js` SDK is permitted only inside `src/infrastructure/posthog/*`. The single bootstrap entry point is `bootstrapPosthog()`, invoked from the project-root `instrumentation-client.ts`; the `__abyssPosthogBootstrapped` global guard makes it idempotent. Feature code communicates with analytics via the typed app-bus event `player-profile:updated` (and, post-Phase 2, the telemetry subscription API); feature code must never import `posthog-js` directly nor learn analytics deployment details (`appVersion`, `buildMode`, analytics timestamps), which are owned by the PostHog adapter. Disabled-mode contract: a null resolved config (no `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_TOKEN`, querystring `?abyss-analytics=off`, `localStorage['abyss-analytics-disabled']='1'`, or browser hostname on localhost / IPv4 loopback) keeps the SDK uninitialized end-to-end. Session-replay posture: `recordCanvas: false` (the WebGPU canvas is never recorded); autocapture is allowlist-only (`click` / `submit` / `change`; `button` / `a` / `input` / `[role="button"]`); broadening either allowlist requires architectural review.
- **Code Quality Protocol**: Enforce the following rules for all code modifications:
  - **Use existing Tailwind classes** (e.g., `opacity-0`, `pointer-events-none`) over inline styles (e.g., `style= opacity: 0, pointerEvents: 'none' `).
  - **JSX Prop Composition Discipline**: Do not inline object literals directly in JSX props (for example, `prop= ... `); always predefine or reuse a variable/constant and pass that variable as the prop.

## Agent Workflow & Decision Framework
Agents must execute the following structured decision process before outputting code modifications to force planned, architectural alignment.

### I. Architectural Alignment Assessment
Before generating code, the agent must evaluate the request against the architecture:
1. **Target Pattern Identification**: Define which architectural pattern governs the proposed change.
2. **Boundary Verification**: Confirm the proposed change maintains Feature-Sliced Modules and Layered Architecture boundaries.
3. **State Strategy**: Validate state modifications. Prefer existing Zustand actions. Introduce new global state patterns only with explicit architectural justification.

### II. Implementation & Testing Execution
1. Identify affected execution paths.
2. Locate and update existing related tests (`src/**/*.test.ts` for unit, `tests/` for e2e) before writing implementation code.
3. Provide necessary unit or e2e tests for new feature paths.

### III. Mandatory Collaboration Output
Every agent response proposing code modifications **must begin** with a **Compliance, Risk & Drift Assessment** (before any code, rationale, or optimization proposal). This assessment enforces zero-tolerance architectural hygiene and must explicitly:

1. **Misalignment Check**
   Systematically verify the entire proposal against **every section** of this CLAUDE.md (Scope, Project Vision, all Architectural Patterns, Mandatory Project Rules, WebGPU Strictness, Mobile-first UI, and Agent Workflow).
   - List and highlight **every** misalignment or potential contradiction.
   - If zero misalignments exist, state verbatim: **"Full alignment with CLAUDE.md confirmed — zero deviations detected."**

2. **Architectural Risk Highlight**
   Identify and rate (Low/Medium/High) every architectural risk introduced by the change, including (but not limited to):
   - Boundary violations or cross-feature coupling
   - Erosion of strict layering, repository pattern, or data-driven execution
   - WebGPU pipeline fragility, TSL/RenderPipeline regressions, or mobile-first violations
   - Scalability, maintainability, or performance impacts on the crystal-garden rendering engine
   For each risk, provide a concrete mitigation that preserves the authoritative architecture.

3. **Prompt Drift Prevention**
   Analyze how the proposed implementation could enable future prompt drift (e.g., introducing patterns that future agents might interpret as permission for workarounds, legacy code, magic strings, or tactical fixes).
   Confirm explicit adherence to “Prioritize Strategic Programming over Tactical fixes” and “No Legacy Burden.”
   If any drift vector exists, state the risk and the exact guardrail added to eliminate it.
