# AGENTS.md

## Scope
Authoritative reference for repository architecture and agent workflows. Codebase contradictions to this document must be resolved in favor of this document.

## Project Vision

Abyss Engine is a **beautiful, immersive spaced-repetition learning platform** built as a 3D crystal garden.
Core fantasy: *Your knowledge literally grows as glowing crystals in a mystical abyss.*

Core stack: React Three Fiber 10+, Drei 11+, WebGPU (Three.js Shading Language), TanStack Query, Zustand, Tailwind, motion.
Core systems: SM-2 progression, ritual-based attunement, buff engine, procedural node-based graphics.

## Architectural Patterns

### 1. Feature-Sliced Modules
- **Rule**: Domain/application modules that encode game-learning behavior must reside exclusively in `src/features/<feature>/`.
- **Boundary Enforcement**: Modules communicate strictly through public APIs defined in `index.ts`. Cross-feature deep imports are prohibited.
- **Dependency Flow**: Features may depend on `infrastructure` and `types`. Unidirectional coupling (feature -> infrastructure/types) is mandatory. Cross-feature coupling must be documented.

### 2. Strict Layered Architecture
- **Types (`src/types`)**: Data contracts and interface shapes. Zero framework or runtime logic.
- **Presentation (`src/components`)**: Rendering and UI event orchestration. Prohibited from owning primary business rules.
- **Features (`src/features`)**: Domain/application modules. This includes **procedural generation models** (mathematical algorithms mapping SM-2 progression to physical growth parameters).
- **Graphics & Rendering (`src/graphics`)**: WebGPU pipelines, TSL node materials, compute shaders, and post-processing effect chains. This layer translates data-driven growth parameters into visual outputs.
- **Composition (`src/hooks`)**: State and query wiring. Prohibited from containing rule-bearing business logic.
- **Infrastructure (`src/infrastructure`)**: External boundaries (I/O, storage, network adapters, realtime wiring).

### 3. Repository Pattern & Data Access
- **Rule**: Direct remote I/O (e.g., `fetch`) is strictly prohibited in domain and component files.
- **Implementation**: Contracts must be defined in `src/types/repository.ts`. Concrete implementations must remain isolated in `src/infrastructure/repositories/*`.
- **Query Orchestration**: Content reads must execute through repository-backed query helpers. Runtime environment decisions (URLs, stale policies, retry behavior) are managed via infrastructure hooks, not domain modules.

### 4. Data-Driven Engine Pattern (Buff System)
- **Separation of Concerns**:
  - `buffDefinitions.ts`: Static configuration and entity definition (what exists).
  - `buffEngine.ts`: Core runtime rules and logic (how it behaves).
  - `buffDisplay.ts`: Presentation mapping (how it looks).
  - `progressionStore.ts`: Lifecycle and state management (when it triggers).

### 5. WebGPU & Mobile-First Graphics Engine
- **Renderer Initialization**: The standard `<Canvas>` import from `@react-three/fiber` is strictly prohibited. You must import `<Canvas>` exclusively from `@react-three/fiber/webgpu` to natively initialize the asynchronous `WebGPURenderer`. Manual `gl` prop instantiation of the WebGPU renderer is deprecated.
- **Drei Component Import Paths**: The root `@react-three/drei` entry point is forbidden, as it defaults to legacy WebGL implementations. All Drei components must be imported via their dedicated WebGPU entry points (e.g., `@react-three/drei/webgpu`).
- **Drei Component Fallbacks**: If a specific Drei utility lacks a WebGPU entry point in v11, its usage is prohibited. You must reconstruct the required functionality from scratch using Three.js Shading Language (TSL) and Node Materials.

## Mandatory Project Rules
- **Data-Driven Execution**: No magic strings. No manual state mapping.
- **No Legacy Burden**: Deprecated behavior must be refactored or removed. Do not preserve dead code.
- **WebGPU Strictness**: Any pull request or code generation that introduces a legacy WebGL material, `WebGLRenderer`, or non-TSL shader string into the codebase will be rejected.

## Agent Workflow & Decision Framework
Agents must execute the following structured decision process before outputting code modifications to force planned, architectural alignment.

### I. Architectural Alignment Assessment
Before generating code, the agent must evaluate the request against the architecture:
1. **Target Pattern Identification**: Define which architectural pattern governs the proposed change.
2. **Boundary Verification**: Confirm the proposed change maintains Feature-Sliced Modules and Layered Architecture boundaries.
3. **State Strategy**: Validate state modifications. Prefer existing Zustand actions. Introduce new global state patterns only with explicit architectural justification.

### II. Implementation & Testing Execution
1. Identify affected execution paths.
2. Locate and update existing related tests (`src/**/*.test.ts` for unit, `tests/` for e2e) before writing implementation code.
3. Provide necessary unit or e2e tests for new feature paths.
4. Run `npm run build` to ensure the codebase compiles.

### III. Mandatory Collaboration Output
Every agent response proposing code changes must begin with an **Architecture Alignment Plan** containing:
1. **Misalignment Risk**: A concise list of potential conflicts between the requested change and current architecture.
2. **Implementation Strategy**: The selected architectural pattern and boundary defense strategy.
3. **Optimization**: Better architectural options if the user's initial request violates system design.

If something in the codebase contradicts AGENTS.md, the codebase is wrong.
Welcome, agent.
Let’s build the most beautiful learning garden in existence. 🌌
